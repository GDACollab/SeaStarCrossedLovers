You mean you’ve never tried?","\n","^Ocean: I took one day off to try, and only got a little more than half of the way there—with the water reaching for me all the while, slowly washing away my spire as I built it.","\n","^Ocean: I had to spend most of the next day recovering from using so much energy.","\n","^Noelani: What if I tried?","\n","^Noelani: I’m a nymph, the extent of my duties is usually just wrangling unruly waves during a storm, guiding lost creatures back to their proper place, and tending to the reef—the other nymphs could cover me for a while!","\n","^Noelani: There’s so many of us, there’s usually not much to do anyways!","\n","^Ocean: The sea will still reach for you and tear down your attempts—not even I can void the flow of water—the most I could do is keep the water slightly calmer when you start, or allow you a short moment of rest.”","\n","^Noelani: Then I’ll just keep building faster than the waves can break it down!","\n","^Noelani: Simple!","\n","^Ocean: Noelani, building such a tower would push the limits of your powers.","\n","^Noelani: At least if I try I have the chance to see her again.
