Moon: why are you so focused on what love means? 

Moon: Yet only limiting it as something you give to others?

Astra: I can’t exactly give something to myself can I? 

Moon: Why not? 

Moon: Love must come from somewhere, doesn’t it? 

Moon: Make some for yourself and aim it towards yourself

Astra: ...

Moon: You seem to be focusing on your love for another to distract from looking at yourself... why? 

Moon: Is having love for oneself so forgien to you? What do you not want to see?

Astra: ... 

Astra: I... 

Astra: After I... Burned Out... when I was stuck down on earth... 

Astra: I was scared... frustrated... worried that all my potential and work to be great would be lost... 

Astra: but after a while,  part of me was... relieved. 

Astra: It was... freeing being able to do nothing. 

Astra: It was relaxing-- which is SO weird. 

Astra: I’ve only ever felt relaxed after I made huge strides in being Bright. 

Astra: But I got the same feeling after making NO progress??? 

Astra: It’s confusing. 

Astra: I’ve worked so hard for so long to live up to being the “Best and Brightest the night had to offer”... 

Astra: But now success seems...less defined??? 

Astra: I’ll have to work just as hard to stay Bright. 

Astra: I enjoy the results I get from all my work, but trying to push myself as hard as I did before just… feels harder/more pointless.

Astra: [Astra reaches the conclusion that reaching her goals in a sustainable way is better than pushing herself to be fully productive all the time]

Moon: That’s very wise, [Moon compliments Astra for her growth]

Astra: [starts talking about her time on the island/ noelani]

Astra: Meeting others so relaxed was strange, too. 

Astra: They worked when they needed too, but usually they just… took it easy? 

Astra: And talked to each other? 

Astra: I hadn’t realized how long its been since I talked to anyone else but you, Moon. 

Astra: It was hard being stuck down there with no else I knew, but once I got to know Noelani... 

Astra: It got so much easier. 

Astra: She’s easy to talk to, and cool, and funny-- 

Astra: I dont think I’ve laughed as much as I did in the month down on earth in years up here.

Moon: ahh, the little sea nymph that came to see you off?

Astra: [Waxes on a bit more about Noelani]

Moon: Dawww, you’re very clearly smitten with this little nymph.

Moon: you remind me of when I first meet the ocean…

Astra: [blush overlay]

Moon: such a courageous little nymph! Determined too, given that she’s almost here…

Astra: Yeah she’s great...

Astra: wait what do you mean she is almost here?
