Moon: What's the problem, Astra? 

Moon: You seem down. Not shining as bright as usual.

Astra: I'm just...confused? 

Astra: I'm normally so invested in my work, but since meeting Noelani, things don't feel the same. 

Astra: She's all I can think about.

Moon: That certainly sounds frustrating. 

Moon: Is there anything I can do to help?

Astra: ...

Astra: ...Is this what love is?

Moon: Love comes in many forms, my dear. 

Moon: Each is unique, and bears its own caveats. 

Astra: You're dodging the question. 

Astra: Is what I'm feeling for Noelani — this confusion and aching — is this what love feels like?

Moon: ...That's not something I can decide for you, child. 

Moon: Love is personal. 

Moon: Love is a journey. 

Moon: Perhaps a good starting point is asking yourself why you feel this way. 

Moon: What is the source of your confusion and anger? 

Moon: Is it Noelani, or is it something else?

Astra: I'll....get back to you on that.
