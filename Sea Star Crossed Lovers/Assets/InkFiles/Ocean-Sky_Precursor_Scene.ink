Ocean: Hey Noelani… are you doing alright? #concerned(eyes), neutral(mouth)

* [“Tell the Ocean the truth”] 

Noelani: No… I really miss Astra. #Sad

Ocean: Ah, I see… it’s been almost a month since she left, hasn’t it? 

Noelani: Yeah… 


* [“Tell the Ocean you’re fine”] 

Noelani: What do you mean? I’m doing fine. No worries at all. #closed eyes, smile
	
Ocean: Noelani… you can say that all you want, but you’re not going to fool me. #grumpy, frown

Ocean: Tell me the truth and I swear it will help you feel better. # concerned, neutral

Noelani: Okay… It’s about Astra. #sad, frown

Noelani: I just...I miss her.



- Noelani: Everything seemed so much more exciting with her around. 

Noelani: She could find joy in the smallest things, even if we weren’t really doing anything at all… # sad, smile

Noelani: I don’t know how you and the Moon manage it.  #sad, neutral

Noelani: How do you deal with the distance?  

Noelani: You guys can see each other once a month, but sometimes you’re both so busy you don’t even get that!  #sad, shout

 
Ocean: Lots of questions, huh? #closed eyes, neutral

Ocean: Unfortunately, you and I — among many others — are bound to this planet. #open eyes, neutral.

Ocean: And despite how close the moon and stars may seem, the distance from here to where they reside is immense. #closed eyes, neutral 

Ocean: Even with all of my power, getting to the heavens would probably take a few days. #open eyes, neutral.

Ocean: If I took that much time off, I’d be neglecting my duties to Earth. #looking away, frown

Ocean: My Moon is much more powerful than I am, and even she has to take part of the month to store energy to make the trip down here, and to recover when she gets back. #closed eyes happy, laugh

Ocean: As much as it sucks to only see each other face to face every so often, that’s as much as we can manage. #sad, smile 

Ocean: So I’m happy with what we have, even if I do feel lonely sometimes. #happy, smile
 
Noelani: Wait… it’d “probably” take a few days? You mean you’ve never tried? #shocked, open mouth(maybe shout)
 
Ocean: I took a day off to try, and only got a little more than half of the way there #looking away (maybe sweat), smile

Ocean: The water was reaching for me the whole time, slowly washing away my spire as I built it. 

Ocean: I had to spend most of the next day recovering from using so much energy. #closed eyes (happy), laugh
 
Noelani: What if I tried? #looking away, neutral

Noelani: I’m a nymph so the extent of my duties is not as much as yours.

Noelani: Wrangling unruly waves during a storm, guiding lost creatures back to their proper place, and tending to the reef...

Noelani: I'm sure the other nymphs could cover me for a while! #happy, shout

Noelani: There’s so many of us so there’s usually not much to do anyways! #closed eyes, smile
 
Ocean: The sea will still reach for you and tear down your attempts. #concerned eyes, open mouth.

Ocean: I can't void the flow of water either so the most I could do is keep the water slightly calmer when you start, or allow you a short moment of rest. #concerned eyes, frown

Noelani: Simple! 
 
Noelani: I’ll just keep building faster than the waves can break it down! #determined, smile
 
Ocean: Noelani, building such a tower would push the limits of your powers.
 
Noelani: But if I try I have the chance to see her again. #Determined, neutral

Noelani: And I'd rather try and fail than live with the uncertainty. #Determined, frown
 
Ocean: *sigh* You’ve already set your mind to it, huh? #closed eyes, smile

Ocean: Well then, give it your all. #content, smile
