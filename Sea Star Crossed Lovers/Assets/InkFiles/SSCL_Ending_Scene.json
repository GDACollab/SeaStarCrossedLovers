Wait a minute how did you even get here?!","\n","^Noelani: oh *huff huff* you know.. *huff huff* just climbed up..","\n","^Astra: Climbed up?","\n","^Astra: There’s no way anyone could climb up from the earth to the moon.","\n","^Noelani: *Huff* not for me there isn’t.","\n","^Noelani: but that’s not what I-","\n","^Astra: Very funny Noelani.","\n","^Astra: But seriously what are you doing here and moreover how are you going to get down?","\n","^Noelani: Uhhh..
